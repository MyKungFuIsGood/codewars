Great place to see my knowledge of Javascript. Repo to hold some of my solutions to the kata's on codewars.com

For potential employers I would like to recommend checking out the sudokuSolver and GeneticAlgorithm.  The sudoku solver showcases a recursive brute force solution for solving sudoku puzzles.  The GeneticAlgorithm shows a basic implimentation of solving a binary genetic algorithm.
